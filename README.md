- Visualization of player performance data through charts and graphs.
- To conclude the Player performance, following points, EDA is used:
     - World statistics
     - Clustering players by Nationality
     - Value & Wages of players with age
     - Value of players with position
     - Overall & Potential with age
     - Variation of overall & potential by country for top countries
     - Correlation matrix - attributes vs potential and overall
     - Variation in wages for top clubs
     - Age vs overall clustered by field position
     - Make your dream team
     - Predicting playing position using player statistics


# Libraries Used

The Player's Performance Reviewer project utilizes several libraries to support its functionality:

**1. NumPy:** NumPy is used extensively in the project to perform mathematical operations and manipulate arrays. For example, NumPy is used to calculate the mean and standard deviation of player performance metrics, such as passing accuracy and goals scored.

**2. Pandas:** Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. The Player's Performance Reviewer utilizes Pandas to load data from CSV files, filter and sort data based on various criteria, and create data frames that can be used for visualization.

**3. Seaborn:** Seaborn is a data visualization library that is used to create various charts and graphs in the Player's Performance Reviewer. Seaborn is used to create bar plots, heatmaps, and scatterplots to visualize player performance data.

**4. Matplotlib.pyplot:** Matplotlib is a data visualization library that is used to create various charts and graphs in the Player's Performance Reviewer. Matplotlib is used to create line plots, histograms, and scatterplots to visualize player performance data.

**5. Missingno:** Missingno is a data visualization library that is used to visualize missing data in the Player's Performance Reviewer. This library is used to visualize any missing data in player performance metrics, which can be helpful in identifying data quality issues.

**5. Datetime:** The datetime library is used to perform date and time manipulation in the Player's Performance Reviewer. This library is used to convert date and time data from CSV files into a format that can be used for analysis and visualization.

**6. Ipywidgets:** Ipywidgets is a library that provides interactive widgets for Jupyter notebooks. The Player's Performance Reviewer utilizes Ipywidgets to create interactive charts and graphs that allow users to filter and explore player performance data in real-time.
